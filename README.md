🖼️ Slide 1: HealthRemindPro
“Never miss a follow-up — for doctors or patients.”
Presented by: Tayanwa Stephen
Date: May 2025

❓ Slide 2: Problem Statement
Clinics and private doctors lose track of patient follow-ups.

Missed follow-up appointments reduce treatment effectiveness.

Manual tracking is time-consuming and error-prone.

Patients often forget or are unaware of follow-up schedules.

Why it matters:
➡️ Missed appointments cost time, money, and can negatively impact patient health outcomes.

💢 Slide 3: Pain Point Understanding
According to health service studies, 20–30% of patients fail to return for follow-up care.

Clinics struggle with:

Limited staff for reminders

No unified tracking system

Lack of integration across communication channels

📉 Result: Lost revenue, reduced patient trust, and poor continuity of care.
